# SweetViz
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is an essential early step in most data science projects and it often consists of taking the same steps to characterize a dataset (e.g. find out data types, missing information, distribution of values, correlations, etc.). Given the repetitiveness and similarity of such tasks, there are a few libraries that automate and help kickstart the process.
One of the latest is a new open-source Python library called Sweetviz.
It packs a powerful punch; in addition to creating insightful and beautiful visualizations with just two lines of code, it provides analysis that would take a lot more time to generate manually, including some that no other library provides so quickly such as:
Comparison of 2 datasets (e.g. Train vs Test)
Visualization of the target value against all other variables (e.g. “What was the survival rate of male vs female” etc.)
